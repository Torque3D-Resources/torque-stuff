# torque-stuff

Practically all of the useful resources i have written for the [Torque Game Engine][1].

Rather than keeping these locked away, i thought i might as well 
put them up for all of the world to see. Beware though, some of 
this stuff could very well be some of my worst code yet. 

Generally speaking, most of these resources are based on TGE 1.3. 
Thus, any included patches will only apply cleanly on that version.

Due to various reasons, the resources here differ from the ones 
originally distributed on GarageGames.
(So don't be suprised if they don't work out of the box)
